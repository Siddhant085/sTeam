BRANCH OVERVIEW
===============

steam-2.9-source is an archive of the original unmodified source that our server is built with.
societyserver-devel is the build that we are currently running made from that source.

because there is no official public steam repository at the moment, we are
collecting our patches in a repository in our binary-build, so that they can be
merged into a steam source repository at a later time.

societyserver-source is a branch with our patches merged on top of steam-2.9-source

steam-packages contains the old sTeam webinterface

any other branches are temporary and should be ignored.
